# Eco_Vision_Predictorr
"An LSTM model to forecast deforestation in Rond√¥nia, Brazil using Google Earth Engine data."

***

## üí° Project Overview

This project provides a robust solution for monitoring and predicting deforestation. It uses historical NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, extracted from **Landsat-8 satellite images**, to train a specialized time-series model.

The primary goal was to analyze changes in the Rond√¥nia state of Brazil (a deforestation hotspot) and forecast its **NDVI value for the year 2025**.

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Key Features

The project follows a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline, showcasing proficiency in geospatial data handling and deep learning:

* **Data Extraction (Google Earth Engine):** Programmatic access and cleaning of historical NDVI data from 2015 to 2024 using the **Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API**.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Time-series preparation, handling of missing values, and normalization for stable model training.
* **Model Building (LSTM):** Implementation of a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, which is uniquely suited for modeling sequential data like NDVI over time.
* **Forecasting:** The trained LSTM model was used to generate a single, projected NDVI value for the target year 2025.

***

## üìà Final Result

Based on the historical data and the trained LSTM model, the predicted NDVI value for the specified area in Rond√¥nia for 2025 is:

> **Predicted NDVI Value (2025): 0.3383**

This value suggests a continued trend of **forest degradation** compared to previous years, validating the model's ability to capture long-term environmental patterns.
